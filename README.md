# Exam  PRO-104 2020
## Group 30

We have created a Kanban board where users can create tasks, assign members to tasks and move the tasks to different status categories. We have implemented drag and drop, English and Norwegian text, description, icons, checklist and date to name some features.

### Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

### How to use:
Create a task and a member. Drag and drop the member to the task you want and drag the task to ongoing or finished if you want. You can also edit or delete the task if you want. You can delete member from the member section as well.
